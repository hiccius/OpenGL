## Chapter 8 - Advanced Lighting
### Content Summary
This section covers chapters *33. Advanced Lighting* and **_[TO BE COMPLETED]_** of [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com).

The examples in this section...

### Examples
The examples can be executed one by one without needing to pass any arguments except for [10. Asteroids](#10-asteroids), which requires an integer value and can also be passed an optional argument. Example [11. Anti-Aliasing](#11-anti-aliasing) accepts an optional argument as well. The examples need to be launched from the root *build* folder so they can find the right path for the shaders. To exit the examples, just press <kbd>ESC</kbd>.

#### 1. Points in space
This example sets the variable *gl_PointSize* equal to the **depth value** when drawing points on the screen, making them appear larger the farther they are from the viewer.
